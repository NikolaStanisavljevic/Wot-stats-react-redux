# World of Tanks Statistics Site

## Description
This is my personal project for statistics from World of Tanks games.I built it using html,css and javascript.In this case i used ReactJs javascript framework and Redux as state menager with Redux DevTools for menagment, also axios client for promise requests.Some of API used is from Wargaming.net and some of data is synchronous and collected with webscraping using Octoparse as tool and it was exported in JSON format.For displaying all data i used Chart.js for building charts and graphics and Reactstrap for building dynamic tables and data calculations.
